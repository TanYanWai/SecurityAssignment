            <p>Have a healthy diet in pregnancy. A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle at any time but is especially vital if you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Eating healthily during pregnancy will help your baby to develop and grow. You do not need to go on a special diet, but it's important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need. It's best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat, but when you're pregnant you need to take a folic acid supplement as well, to make sure you get everything you need.</p >

            <p>You should contact your GP surgery or local midwife service as soon as you find out you're pregnant (before 8 weeks into the pregnancy). It's important to see a midwife as early as possible to get the antenatal (pregnancy) care and information you need to have a healthy pregnancy. If youâ€™re not registered with a GP, you can find a GP in your area and contact them to register. Your pregnancy can be treated confidentially, even if you're under 16. A GP or midwife can tell you about your choices for antenatal care in your local area. Being pregnant may affect the treatment of any current illness or conditions you have or later develop.</p >

            <p>Antenatal care is the care you get from health professionals during your pregnancy. It's sometimes called pregnancy care or maternity care. You'll be offered appointments with a midwife, or sometimes a doctor who specialises in pregnancy and birth (an obstetrician). You should start your antenatal care as soon as possible once you know you're pregnant. You can do this by contacting a midwife or GP.</p >
